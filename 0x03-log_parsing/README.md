# Log Parsing

This repository contains code for log parsing. Log parsing is the process of extracting relevant information from log files, such as error messages, timestamps, and other data.

## Usage

To parse a log file, run the following command:

```
python 0-stats.py /path/to/log/file.log
```

This will output the parsed information from the log file.
