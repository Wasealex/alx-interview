# Prime Game

This is a command line game written in Python that allows two players to play a game of prime numbers. The game is played by each player taking turns to enter a number. If the number is a prime number, the player gets a point. The game continues until one of the players reaches a score of 3, at which point the game ends and the winner is declared.
