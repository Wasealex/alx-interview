# Pascal's Triangle

Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of numbers where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. It is named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal.

To generate Pascal's Triangle, follow these steps:

1. Start with a row containing only the number 1.
2. Each subsequent row is generated by adding the numbers in the previous row. The first and last numbers in each row are always 1.
3. To calculate the numbers in between, add the two numbers directly above it in the previous row.

Here is an example of Pascal's Triangle with 5 rows:

```
    1
       1 1
      1 2 1
     1 3 3 1
    1 4 6 4 1
```

Pascal's Triangle has many interesting properties and applications in mathematics and computer science. It can be used to calculate binomial coefficients, solve combinatorial problems, and even generate fractal patterns.
