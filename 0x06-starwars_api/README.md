# RESTful API - Star Wars Characters

This README file provides information about the RESTful API for retrieving Star Wars characters. The API is implemented in the `0-starwars_characters.js` file.

## Usage

To use the API, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies by running the command `npm install`.
2. Run the script `0-starwars_characters.js` with the desired number of characters to retrieve. For example, to retrieve 3 characters, run the command `node 0-starwars_characters.js 3`.

```shell
node 0-starwars_characters.js 3
```

3. The script will make a request to the Star Wars API and retrieve the specified number of characters. The character information will be displayed in the console.

That's it! You can now use the RESTful API to retrieve Star Wars characters.
