# UTF-8 Validation

UTF-8 validation refers to the process of verifying whether a given sequence of bytes represents a valid UTF-8 encoded string. UTF-8 is a widely used character encoding that supports the representation of various languages and characters.

In Python, one approach to perform UTF-8 validation is by utilizing bit manipulation techniques. By examining the binary representation of each byte in the sequence, we can determine if it adheres to the UTF-8 encoding rules. This involves checking the number of leading bits and the pattern of subsequent bytes.

## usage

Here is a sample code snippet that demonstrates how to use the file:

```python
validUTF8 = __import__('0-validate_utf8').validUTF8
```

then use it with list of numbers as input
