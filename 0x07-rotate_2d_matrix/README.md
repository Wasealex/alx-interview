# transposing a matrix or rotating a matrix

To rotate a 2D matrix in Python without using any modules

1. Transpose the matrix: Swap the elements at position (i, j) with the elements at position (j, i) for all valid indices.

2. Reverse each row: Reverse the elements in each row of the transposed matrix.

This implementation modifies the original matrix in-place. If you want to keep the original matrix unchanged, you can create a copy of it before performing the rotations.
